# BinarySearchTree
A binary search tree is a specialized binary tree where the value of each node is greater than the values in its left subtree and less than the values in right sub tree.
In this project, I have performed traversals like inorder,preorder and postorder.
I have also performed operations like insertion, deletion, searching.
